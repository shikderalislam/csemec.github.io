# coreSlider
jQuery BEM-style slider plugin

For more information see [DEMO](http://typical000.github.io/coreSlider/)

Setup
-----
Add this tags to the `<head>` of your document (of before the `</body>` tag). This will link jQuery, slider CSS and JS into your web-page.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="coreSlider.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="coreSlider.css"/>
```

Markup
------
Very good thins is that there is no restrictions to markup (So, all who loves BEM-style developing will like this :)). You can use any classes and nesting you need (because any tag can be configured on slider initialization) in difference of other plugins, where markup, or classname are hardcoded inside plugin. But there are few things that you must follow:

* Slider must have a 'viewport' (block, that will 'cut off' other slides that are outside of slider area of visibility). Default value is `.core-slider_viewport`;
* All slides must be wrapped with a container (in fact, this container will move on slide-change event, not each slide). For beautiful movement animation you can attach to this block some custom transition timing function. Default value is `.core-slider_list`;
* Slider must have containers for arrows and dots controls (you can disable this controls if you need). Default classes are: `.core-slider_nav` and `.core-slider_control-nav`.

As a canonical markup can be considered following HTML: 
```html
<div class="core-slider">
  <div class="core-slider_viewport">
    <div class="core-slider_list">
      <div class="core-slider_item">
        Foo
      </div>
      <div class="core-slider_item">
        Bar
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="core-slider_nav">
    <div class="core-slider_arrow core-slider_arrow__left"></div>
    <div class="core-slider_arrow core-slider_arrow__right"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="core-slider_control-nav"></div>
</div>
```

Initialize
----------
In last step, add the folowing lines of JavaScript into the `<head>` of your document (of before the `</body>` tag).

```html
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
 $(window).load(function() {
   $('.core-slider').coreSlider();
 });
</script>
```

The `$(window).load()` function is required to ensure the content of the page is loaded before the plugin initializes (because, sizes are calculated from slides content, and, if there is no images are loaded, content can be set as 0px width and height). Anyway, if you slider have strict sizes defined in CSS, you can change `$(window).load()` function to `$(document).ready()` function.

Options & API
-------
Listed below are all of the options available to customize slider to suite your needs.

```js
interval: 5000,                                         // Interval of time between slide changes
loop: true,                                             // When slider finish, should it loop again from first slide?
slideshow: true,                                        // Enable/Disable automatic slideshow
resize: true,                                           // Should be slider responsive on screen resize
pauseOnHover: true,                                     // Pause the slideshow when hovering over slider
startOnHover: false,                                    // Start the slideshow when hovering over slider
sliderSelector: '.core-slider_list',                    // List selector (all items are inside this container)
viewportSelector: '.core-slider_viewport',              // Viewport selector
itemSelector: '.core-slider_item',                      // Slider items selector
navEnabled: true,                                       // Enable/Disable navigation arrows
navSelector: '.core-slider_nav',                        // Selector for navigation arrows container
navItemNextSelector: '.core-slider_arrow__right',       // 'Next' arrow selector
navItemPrevSelector: '.core-slider_arrow__left',        // 'Prev' arrow selector
controlNavEnabled: false,                               // Enable/Disable control navigation (dots)
controlNavSelector: '.core-slider_control-nav',         // Control navigation container selector (inside will be created dots items)
controlNavItemSelector: 'core-slider_control-nav-item', // Single control nav dot (created dynamically. Write without dot. If you need more that one class - add them with space separator)
loadedClass: 'is-loaded',                               // Classname, that will be added when slider is fully loaded
clonedClass: 'is-cloned',                               // Classname, that will be added to cloned slides (see option 'clone')
hiddenClass: 'is-hidden',                               // Classname, indicates hidden things
disabledClass: 'is-disabled',                           // Classname, that will be added it item is disabled (in most of cases - item will be display: noned)
activeClass: 'is-active',                               // Classname, that will be added to active items (for example control navs, etc.)
reloadGif: false,                                       // Reload gif's on slide change for replaying cycled animation inside current slide
clone: false,                                           // Indicates, that at begin and at end of slider carousel items will be cloned to create 'infitite' carousel illusion
items: 1,                                               // How mutch items will be placed inside viewport. Leave 1 if this is slider, 2 ot more - it will look like a carousel
itemsPerSlide: 1,                                       // How many items must be slided by one action (NOTE: Must be less than 'items' option)
cloneItems: 0                                           // How mutch items will be cloned at begin and at end of slider

// Callbacks API
before: function() {}, // Callback function - fires before each slider animation
after: function() {},  // Callback function - fires after each slider animation
init: function() {},   // Callback function - fires after slider was initialized
```
You can also perform actions on coreSlider instances. E.g.:
```js
$('#slider').coreslider('update');  // Update slideshow (useful when you remove/add slides)
$('#slider').coreslider('play');    // Play slideshow
$('#slider').coreslider('stop');    // Stop slideshow
$('#slider').coreslider('destroy'); // Destroy slideshow instance
$('#slider').coreslider('next');    // Go to next slide
$('#slider').coreslider('prev');    // Go to prev slide
$('#slider').coreslider(3);         // Go to the third slide
```


Browser Support
---------------
All modern versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, iOS, Android, Internet Explorer and Edge have been tested and are supported. Also, due to usage of CSS3 animations, in IE9 slider looks like a piece of shit. But if you support these old browsers your soul will burn in hell :)
